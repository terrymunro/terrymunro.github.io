## Course Structure

The course is fast paced and we will cover a lot of ground over the next 4 days:

  * Day 1: Basic Scala, types and inference.
  * Day 2: Pattern matching, standard library, enums and immutable data classes
  * Day 3: Traits, Type Constructors, Testing and Error Handling
  * Day 4: ??? Profit

> Look I don't know why I'm just cloning this other guide but rewriting it for scala, I'm shit and need something to give me reasonable structure because I have no idea what I'm doing.
