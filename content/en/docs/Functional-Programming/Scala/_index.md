This is a four day Scala course loosely based off [Google's Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/). The course will attempt to cover the full spectrum of Scala 3, from basic syntax to advanced topics like higher-kinded types, effect libraries and tagless final style programs.

## Goals

The goals of the course is to get you to a working understanding of advanced Scala. In this course I will assume you don't know anything about Scala and I hope to:

 * Give you a rough understanding of Scala's advanced features
 * Enable you to read and contribute to Scala programs that use these features
 * Hopefully convince you that writing software like this is **productive**, rewarding and all around fun ðŸ˜¹

## Non-Goals

Unless you already have experience with other FP languages like Haskell, it is probably going to take more than a few days to completely learn Scala. So some non-goals of this course are:

 * Learn about a lot of the [OOP side of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/domain-modeling-oop.html)
 * Learn how to use [Akka](https://akka.io/)
 * Learn about [variance](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/types-variance.html) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)))

## Assumptions

This course assumes that you already know how to program. Scala is a statically typed language and there might be some comparative references to Haskell but I will also try to use TypeScript in-case that's easier.

You don't have to know functional programming, but it will be the primary paradigm used in this course.
