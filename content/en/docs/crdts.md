  CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) are data structures that allow multiple replicas of a shared data set to be kept in sync without the need for a central authority or global clock, using techniques such as convergence, idempotence, and commutativity to resolve conflicts and ensure consistency among the replicas.
