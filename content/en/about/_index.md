## Who am I?

Hi! I am one of the [Lead Engineers](https://aginic.com/our-people/) at [Aginic](https://aginic.com/). I'm both shy and an introvert, but I am forcing myself to write this as a way to [improve my writing and communication skills](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-more-you-write-the-better-you-are-at-explaining-your-work-708be316defc).

I'm the type of person who isn't so fond of expressing myself publically. But I thought I should give some background and reasoning behind me writing this to temper any expectations ðŸ˜¹.

I have been a software developer for around 13 years and within the last year or so also adding data engineering to the mix. I am the first to admit, I'm not particularly expert at any one thing. The embodiment of jack of all trades master of none. I think I've used a different technology on every single project I've ever been on. The upside to this, I feel, is that I've gotten quite good at learning new things quickly and even though I may not be an expert at any specific subset of our craft, I have picked up a lot of experience along the way.

Which brings me to why I am writing this, and what you may get out of it should you choose to read any of it. I want to share what I know or what I'm learning with others but my problem is, I am too shy to give talks, and I have never been great at writing. So by writing these posts I hope to slowly improve at writing while sharing what I am learning or old topics that I decided to revisit.


So, if you've made it this far, thank you and I hope I can write about something that will interest you. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions please let me know in whatever way suits you most.

p.s. I have three cats, so I might slip photos of them in my posts to sweeten the pot.
