So some non-goals of this course are:\nLearn about a lot of the OOP side of Scala Learn how to use Akka Learn about variance (Wikipedia) Assumptions This course assumes that you already know how to program.

Who Am I? Hi! I am one of the Lead Engineers at Aginic. Iâ€™m both shy and an introvert, but I am forcing myself to write this as a way to improve my writing and communication skills.\nIâ€™m the type of person who isnâ€™t so fond of expressing myself publicly. But I thought I should give some background and reasoning behind me writing this to temper any expectations ðŸ˜¹.\nI have been a software developer for around 13 years and within the last year or so also adding data engineering to the mix. I am the first to admit, Iâ€™m not particularly expert at any one thing. The embodiment of jack of all trades master of none. I think Iâ€™ve used a different technology on every single project Iâ€™ve ever been on. The upside to this, I feel, is that Iâ€™ve gotten quite good at learning new things quickly and even though I may not be an expert at any specific subset of our craft, I have picked up a lot of experience along the way.\nWhich brings me to why I am writing this, and what you may get out of it should you choose to read any of it. I want to share what I know or what Iâ€™m learning with others but my problem is, I am too shy to give talks, and I have never been great at writing. So by writing these posts I hope to slowly improve at writing while sharing what I am learning or old topics that I decided to revisit.\nSo, if youâ€™ve made it this far, thank you and I hope I can write about something that will interest you. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions please let me know in whatever way suits you most.\nGitHub https://github.com/terrymunro LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/terrymunro Keybase https://keybase.io/terrymunro Mastodon https://mastodon.au/@terrymunro p.s.
